# Tenant Union Bootstrap5 theme

[Bootstrap 5](https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap5) subtheme.

## Development.

### CSS compilation.

Prerequisites: install [sass](https://sass-lang.com/install).

To compile, run from subtheme directory: `sass scss/style.scss css/style.css && sass scss/ck5style.scss css/ck5style.css`

### Templates

Before you create a new template, make sure that one does not already exist in our base theme (Bootstrap 5, which is in drupal-src/web/themes/contrib/bootstrap5/). If one does exist, copy it into the same location as our own template folder and modify it from there. If one does *not* exist, then create a new one in the most appropriate folder.
